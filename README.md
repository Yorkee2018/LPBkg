# The "LPBkg" Package

The LPBkg package provides a Python implementation for the **detection of new signals under background mismodelling** algorithm, proposed in **S. Algeri, 2019**. The algorithm implements a unified statistical strategy to perform modeling, estimation, inference, and signal characterization under background mismodeling. The methodology proposed in **S. Algeri, 2019** allows to incorporate the (partial) scientific knowledge available on the background distribution and provides a data-updated version of it in a **purely nonparametric fashion** without requiring the specification of prior distributions.

Further details and theory about the algorithm can be found in the **"Detecting new signals under background mismodelling", arXiv:1906.06615** [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.06615.pdf).
