# The "LPBkg" Package
This package provides an implementation for the New Signals Detection Under Background Mismodelling (LPBkg) algorithm, as proposed by S. Algeri in the **"Detecting new signals under background mismodelling", arXiv:1906.06615.** LPBkg algorithm provides a unified statistical strategy to perform modeling, estimation, inference, and signal characterization under background mismodeling. The method proposed allows to incorporate the (partial) scientific knowledge available on the background distribution and provides a data-updated version of it in a purely nonparametric fashion without requiring the specification of prior distributions

## Available Implementations

At this time, the 'LPBkg' is available right out of the box to the general public for personal use in the following programming languages:
- [R(To be uploaded to CRAN] - [Code and Tutorial](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nikTqVCR-VIxkOL7F6OQAXYlmeoK-AST/view)
- [Python](https://pypi.org/project/LPBkg/) - [User Guide](https://github.com/Yorkee2018/LPBkg/tree/master/python)
