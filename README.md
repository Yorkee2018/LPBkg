# The "LPBkg" Package
This package provides an implementation for the New Signals Detection Under Background Mismodelling (LPBkg) algorithm, as proposed by S. Algeri in the **"Detecting new signals under background mismodelling", arXiv:1906.06615.** LPBkg algorithm provides a unified statistical strategy to perform modeling, estimation, inference, and signal characterization under background mismodeling. The method proposed allows to incorporate the (partial) scientific knowledge available on the background distribution and provides a data-updated version of it in a purely nonparametric fashion without requiring the specification of prior distributions

Python version now is uploaded to PYPI. You can see [[here](https://pypi.org/project/LPBkg/)] in PYPI or [[here] https://github.com/Yorkee2018/LPBkg/tree/master/python] in Github for more information. 

R version is going to be uploaded to CRAN. For now you can see [[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nikTqVCR-VIxkOL7F6OQAXYlmeoK-AST/view)] for mor information.
